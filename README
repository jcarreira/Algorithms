This repository contains algorithm libraries I have implemented over time.

Description:

whitebook.pdf: A pdf with algorithms to be used in algorithmic competitions (e.g., ICPC)
closest_pair: library that calculates the closest pair of points from a set of points in O(nlogn)
kadane: Kadane's DP algorithm to calculate the subarray with maximum sum in O(n^3)
